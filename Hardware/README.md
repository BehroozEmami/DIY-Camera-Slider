We are trying to use off-the-shelf components wherever possible to make this open-source open-hardware project accessible to everyone.
The custom PCB is optional. Manufacturing files are in `Manufacturing files` folder. Source files are in `Altium Source Files` which you could use to modify the design.

## Active BOM

If you decide to build the PCB, you can follow the [Active BOM](https://sasakaranovic.com/activebom/diy-camera-slider.html) to help you visualize where
each component is placed and help during assembly.
